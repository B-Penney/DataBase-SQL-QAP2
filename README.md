# DataBase-SQL-QAP2
Objective
Complete both provided problems below, make sure to include all SQL to create the tables, insert the data and perform all queries.

Problem 1: University Course Enrollment System
Scenario
You’re tasked with developing a system to manage university students, professors, courses, and their enrollments.

A single student can register for multiple courses
A single professor can teach multiple courses
A course can only have one professor
A course can have multiple students

Requirements

Create Tables:

students: Store the following columns:
id (auto-incrementing primary key)
first_name (first name of the student)
last_name (last name of the student)
email (student email)
school_enrollment_date (the date when the student enrolled in school)

professors: Store the following columns:
id (auto-incrementing primary key)
first_name (first name of the professor)
last_name (last name of the professor)
department (professor’s department)

courses: Store the following columns:
id (auto-incrementing primary key)
course_name (name of the course)
course_description (brief description of the course)
professor_id (foreign key referencing professors(id))

enrollments: Store the following columns:
student_id (foreign key referencing students(id))
course_id (foreign key referencing courses(id))
enrollment_date (the date of enrollment in the course)
Make student_id and course_id a composite primary key.

Insert Data:
Insert at least 5 students, 4 professors, and 3 courses.
Enroll multiple students in different courses, making sure there are at least 5 enrollments in total.

Tasks

Write SQL Queries:
Retrieve the full names (by full name we mean the first name and last name joined into one column, separated by a space) of all students enrolled in “Physics 101”.
Retrieve a list of all courses along with the professor’s full name who teaches each course.
Retrieve all courses that have students enrolled in them.

Update Data:
Update one of the student’s emails.

Delete Data:
Remove a student from one of their courses.

Problem 2: Online Store Inventory and Orders System
Scenario
You are developing a system to manage products, customers, and their orders in an online store.

Requirements

products: Store the following columns:
id (auto-incrementing primary key)
product_name (name of the product)
price (price of the product)
stock_quantity (current stock level of the product)
customers: Store the following columns:
id (auto-incrementing primary key)
first_name (customer’s first name)
last_name (customer’s last name)
email (customer’s email)

orders: Store the following columns:
id (auto-incrementing primary key)
customer_id (foreign key referencing customers(id))
order_date (date when the order was placed)
order_items: Store the following columns:
order_id (foreign key referencing orders(id))
product_id (foreign key referencing products(id))
quantity (quantity of the product in the order)
Make order_id and product_id a composite primary key.

Insert Data:
Insert at least 5 products, 4 customers, and 5 orders (each order should have at least two items ordered)

Tasks

Write SQL Queries:
Retrieve the names and stock quantities of all products.
Retrieve the product names and quantities for one of the orders placed.
Retrieve all orders placed by a specific customer (including the ID’s of what was ordered and the quantities).

Update Data:
Perform an update to simulate the reducing of stock quantities of items after a customer places an order. Please describe or indicate which order you are simulating the reducton for

Delete Data:
Remove one of the orders and all associated order items from the system.
